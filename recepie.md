# Instructions
Pre heat the oven at 350 deg F/ 180 deg C
## Preparing the pan
Brush two 6” cake pans or one 8” cake pan with oil on the bottom and the circumference too. Now dust it with some flour to coat the pan.
Cut and line the pans with parchment round at the bottom.
Preparing dry and liquid ingredients
In a large bowl sift all dry ingredients.
In another bowl place all liquid ingredients and sugar.
Whip until the sugar granules are almost melted .
Now pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and whip until lump free.
Do not overmix.
Bake for 28-32 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Once done take it out of the oven carefully.
Let the cake cool in the pans for 10 minutes.
Now run a butter knife around the circumference of the cake to rlease it.
Now invert the cakes on the cooling rack to cool completely.
Loosely cover the cakes with a muslin cloth or kitchen towel to prevent drying out.
## For the mango pudding
While the cake is baking quickly blend or whisk the ingredients called for pudding together into a smooth paste. Add more sugar if the mixture isn't sweet.
In a non stick pan cook the mixture on low heat stirring occasionally.
Once the pudding mixture warms up stir continuously scrapping the sides and bottom to avoid sticking.
The pudding is done when the mixture starts to thicken up and coats the back of the spoon well.
Mango pudding should be done under 10 minutes start to finish.
It will thicken more after cooling down.
## Assembling the cake
Refer to the pictorial given above.
Slice the top of the cakes to level if there is a dome .
Cut the cakes into half.
Now spread some mango pudding over the first layer topping it with a layer of frosting.
Repeat for all the layers while stacking them.
You may tint the frosting with your choice of colors.
Now frost on the top and the sides as desired.
Peel and cut a mango into half . Cut thin slices . Arrange the slices in a circle starting at the center to form a rose.
Fill the icing bag with dual color frosting and pipe swirls if desired.
Refrigerate the cake at least 2 hours before eating.

## Notes
## Frosting recipe here.
I have updated the recipe by putting weight measurements as on 06/01/2020
I re tested the recipe using canned mango puree as fresh mangoes were unavailable. 
Possible Substitutes - 
Swap cornstarch for equal amount of all purpose flour, rice flour, potato starch or arrowroot. 
Increase sugar by additional 1/3rd  cup if mangoes aren’t sweet and if you are using fresh mango puree. 
### Additional tips -
If you are not making the pudding or the frosting then do add 1/4th  teaspoon cardamom powder and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the cake batter. 
I have used French tip to pipe swirls on the cake.
I have baked the cake in two 6" pans.
If using only one pan or  8" or 9" pan then baking time increases to 35-40 minutes.
Every oven is different. 
Always insert a toothpick in the center of the cake to check if it's done. 
It should come clean and not with sticky batter. 
Use fresh baking powder and soda. 
Storage
Always refrigerated . Stays well up to 3 days .
Or freeze the sponge cake without frosting wrapped in cling wrap and then foil for up to 3 months. 
Thaw at room temperature .
